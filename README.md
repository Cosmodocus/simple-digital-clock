# simple-digital-clock
##Overview
I created this project using html, css, and javascript.

I learnt some new properties and methods creating this project such as:
  - setInterval()
  - new Date()
  - .getHours, .getMinutes, .getSeconds

##LearningJourney
This was great for understanding more concepts that I can add onto other projects, as I'm sure many projects will require the time of some sort. What I found really fascinating was the setInterval() object. I didn't realize that simply retrieving the current time would only statically display them. With setInterval, I understand that I can update the time for every 1000 millisecond(1 second) accordingly. 

##FuturePlans
I would love to update the UI design, set an alarm, and change the time from military to standard time. I will return to update as I progress.

Please feel free to change or edit as you please.
